📘 HVAC Power Consumption Prediction – ML Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict power consumption for an HVAC system using historical meter data.
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, SHAP explainability, and automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

🚀 Features
✅ Complete ML Pipeline

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Train/test split

Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model selection

Metrics generation (RMSE, R², MAE, MAPE)

SHAP explainability

✅ Automated CI/CD Pipeline

Uses GitHub Actions to run the pipeline:

On every push to main

On manual trigger

Automatically every day at 2 AM UTC

Outputs include:

Trained model files

SHAP plots

Metrics CSV

Saved inside outputs/ and uploaded as GitHub Artifacts

🧠 How This Works
1️⃣ Data is read from data/HVAC_data.xlsx

Daily-appending machine-meter data can be plugged in directly.

2️⃣ ML pipeline trains and evaluates models

The pipeline:

Cleans data

Encodes/normalizes features

Tests multiple ML models

Selects the best model

Saves results into outputs/

3️⃣ SHAP report is automatically generated

Explains model behavior feature-wise.


CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Your pipeline performs:

Install dependencies

Run the HVAC pipeline

Save SHAP plots + metrics

Upload outputs as artifacts

Users can download artifacts directly from the Actions → Workflow Run → Artifacts section.
